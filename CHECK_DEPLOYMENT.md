# ✅ Check Deployment Status

## If "GitHub Actions" is Selected (No Save Button Needed)

When you select "GitHub Actions" as the source, GitHub Pages is automatically enabled! No save button is needed.

## Next Steps:

### 1. Go to Actions Tab
1. Click the **"Actions"** tab at the top of your repository
2. You should see a workflow called **"Deploy to GitHub Pages"**

### 2. Check Workflow Status
- If you see the workflow running (yellow/orange icon) → Wait for it to complete
- If you see a green checkmark ✅ → Deployment successful!
- If you see a red X ❌ → There was an error (check the logs)

### 3. If No Workflow Appears
The workflow might need to be triggered. You can:
- Make a small change and push again, OR
- Go to Actions → "Deploy to GitHub Pages" → Click "Run workflow" button

### 4. Your Site URL
Once deployment completes, your site will be at:
```
https://chimataraghuram.github.io/PROJECT-FINDER/
```

## Quick Check:
- Go to **Actions** tab → Look for "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
- If it's running or completed → Everything is working! 🎉
- If nothing appears → The workflow might need to be triggered manually
